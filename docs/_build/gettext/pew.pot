#: ../../pew.rst:27
msgid "Return a number telling which keys (or buttons) have been pressed since the last check.  The number can then be filtered with the ``&`` operator and the ``K_X``, ``K_DOWN``, ``K_LEFT``, ``K_RIGHT``, ``K_UP``, and ``K_O`` constants to see whether any of the keys was pressed."

msgid "Wait until ``delay`` seconds have passed since the last call to this function. You can call it every frame to ensure a constant frame rate."

#: ../../pew.rst:49
msgid "Creates a new Pix and initialzes its contents by iterating over ``lines`` and then over individual pixels in each line. All the lines have to be at least as long as the first one."

msgid "Creates a new Pix and renders the specified text on it. It is exactly the size needed to fit the specified text. Newlines and other control characters are rendered as spaces."

msgid "If ``color`` is not specified, it will use yellow and red for the letters by default. Otherwise it will use the specified color, with ``background`` color as the background."

#: ../../pew.rst:63
msgid "Alternatively, ``colors`` may be specified as a 4-tuple of colors, and then the ``color`` and ``background`` arguments are ignored, and the four specified colors are used for rendering the text."

msgid "If ``color`` is specified, sets the pixel at location ``x``, ``y`` to that color. If not, returns the color of the pixel at that location."

msgid "If the location is out of bounds of the drawing surface, returns 0."

msgid "Draws a filled box with the specified ``color`` with its top left corner at the specified location and of the specified size. If no location and size are specified, fills the whole drawing surface."

#: ../../pew.rst:88
msgid "If ``key`` color is specified, that color is considered transparent on the source image, and is not copied onto this drawing surface."
